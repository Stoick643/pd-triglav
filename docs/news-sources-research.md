# News Sources Research - Future Enhancement

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current `daily_news.py` implementation uses NewsAPI for general news aggregation. While this provides a solid foundation and working infrastructure, it has significant limitations for specialized mountaineering content.

### NewsAPI Limitations for Climbing Content

1. **Too General**: NewsAPI aggregates mainstream news sources that rarely cover niche climbing/mountaineering topics
2. **Limited Specialized Sources**: Most dedicated climbing websites are not indexed by NewsAPI
3. **Poor Search Results**: Even broad terms like "rock climbing" yield few relevant articles
4. **Geographic Bias**: Limited coverage of European/Slovenian climbing content
5. **Content Quality**: General news sources lack the technical depth climbing enthusiasts expect

## Recommended Future Enhancements

### 1. Specialized Climbing Websites (Primary Recommendation)

**Key Sources to Integrate:**
- **Planetmountain.com** - International climbing news, expeditions, gear reviews
- **Gripped.com** - Canadian-based, excellent worldwide coverage
- **American Alpine Club (americanalpineclub.org)** - Authoritative source for alpine news
- **UKC (ukclimbing.com)** - UK climbing community, European coverage
- **8a.nu** - Sport climbing news, athlete profiles, competition results
- **Desnivel.com** - Spanish language, strong Himalayan coverage
- **Explorersweb** - Expedition and adventure news
- **IFSC Official** - Competition results and news
- **Slovenian Alpine Association (PZS)** - Local content

**Implementation Methods:**
- **Web Scraping**: Use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract articles from news sections
- **RSS Feeds**: Many sites offer RSS feeds (simpler implementation)
- **Direct API Integration**: Contact sites for potential API access

### 2. RSS Feed Integration

**Advantages:**
- Simpler than web scraping
- Real-time updates
- Structured data format
- Respectful to source websites

**Implementation:**
```python
import feedparser

# Example RSS feeds to monitor
rss_feeds = [
    'https://www.planetmountain.com/en/rss.xml',
    'https://gripped.com/feed/',
    'https://www.ukclimbing.com/news/rss'
]

def fetch_rss_news():
    for feed_url in rss_feeds:
        feed = feedparser.parse(feed_url)
        # Process entries...
```

### 3. Google Custom Search API Integration

**Benefits:**
- Search within specific climbing websites
- Better relevancy than general NewsAPI
- Can target multiple specialized sources

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
# Example site-specific searches
search_queries = [
    "site:planetmountain.com climbing competition",
    "site:gripped.com alpine news",
    "site:ukclimbing.com new routes"
]
```

**Alternative APIs:**
- **Serper API** - Google search results via API
- **SerpApi** - Comprehensive search API with Google support

### 4. Federation and Organization APIs

**Official Sources:**
- **IFSC API** - Competition results, rankings, news
- **UIAA** - International mountaineering federation
- **National Alpine Associations** - Country-specific content

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: RSS Feed Integration
- Identify RSS feeds from top climbing sites
- Implement `feedparser` integration
- Add RSS sources to existing relevancy scoring system

### Phase 2: Web Scraping
- Implement scraping for sites without RSS feeds
- Use rotating proxies and respectful crawling practices
- Add content extraction and cleaning

### Phase 3: Search API Integration
- Integrate Google Custom Search or alternatives
- Implement site-specific search strategies
- Combine with existing content sources

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Real-time content monitoring
- Machine learning for relevancy improvement
- User preference customization
- Content caching and archiving

## Technical Considerations

### Rate Limiting and Ethics
- Implement respectful crawling delays
- Honor robots.txt files
- Consider reaching out to sites for API access
- Cache content to minimize requests

### Content Quality
- Implement content deduplication across sources
- Add source credibility scoring
- Filter out low-quality or promotional content

### Maintenance
- Monitor for website structure changes
- Update scrapers when sites redesign
- Maintain RSS feed URLs

## Integration with Existing System

The current `daily_news.py` infrastructure (deduplication, relevancy scoring, language handling) is well-designed and can be extended to work with these specialized sources. The scoring algorithm will be particularly effective with higher-quality source material.

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep NewsAPI as fallback source
- Gradually migrate to specialized sources
- Maintain existing API structure for frontend integration

## Estimated Implementation Effort

- **RSS Integration**: 1-2 days
- **Basic Web Scraping**: 3-5 days  
- **Search API Integration**: 2-3 days
- **Testing and Refinement**: 2-3 days

**Total**: ~10-15 days for comprehensive specialized news system
